# ChemPer-table
ChemPer table is an application developed for school students. ChemPer is an acronymn used for chemistry periodic table which was invented by Dmitri Mendeleev.

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. The table also shows four rectangular blocks: s-, p-, d- and f-block. In general, within one row the elements are metals on the left-hand side and non-metals on the right-hand side.
The rows of the table are called periods; the columns are called groups. Six groups (columns) have names as well as numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18, the noble gases. The periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements, and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized. The periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences.

Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was a Russian chemist and inventor. He formulated the Periodic Law, created his own version of the periodic table of elements, and used it to correct the properties of some already discovered elements and also to predict the properties of eight elements yet to be discovered.

Periodic table is categorised into 4 sections generally called 'Blocks'
S block
D block
F block
P block
 which are further subdivided into groups and periods.
